Collecting the tweets using takes about 5-6 hours as twitter has an hourly limit. The cleaning part takes about 1 minute but the sentiment assignment part will take about 25-30 minutes.

I am sharing the links of all those data files uploaded in my One Drive folder from where it can be downloaded in order for you to save a lot of time. After downloading place the missing files in the "submission/data" folder. The total size of all of the data files is about 80 MB.

When the getTweets.py module is executed, it will ask for an encryption key, which will allow you to use my Tweeter API access keys to collect tweets. If you are authorized, you can use my tweeter tokens using the key. Otherwise, please collect a Tweeter developer account and use your own keys.
Else, one is welcomed to download the data from my OneDrive and use it.
